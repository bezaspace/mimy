# MayIMeetYou App - Agile Development Backlog

**Version:** 1.0  
**Date:** November 17, 2025  
**Overview:** This document serves as the actionable backlog for our tech team to build the full release of MayIMeetYou.app. It's structured around **Epics** (high-level themes grouping related features), **User Stories** (specific, user-focused tasks with acceptance criteria), and **User Flows** (step-by-step visualizations of key journeys). We've prioritized clarity: Each story includes who (persona), what (feature), why (benefit), and testable criteria. No assumptions—everything is explicit. All features listed are required for the initial full release. Free app only—no monetization features.

**Assumptions (To Avoid Confusion):**
- Users are authenticated via Google Sign-In only.
- App is a mobile-first responsive web app built with Next.js; works on desktop and mobile browsers (no separate native app).
- All features are bidirectional (any user can initiate/receive).
- Data privacy: GDPR-compliant; audios delete after 7 days if unmatched.
- No tech details (e.g., APIs, DB schemas)—focus on behavior.

**Prioritization:**
- All Epics and User Stories listed below are required for the full application launch.

## Epic 1: User Onboarding & Profile Management
**Description:** New users sign up, build profiles, and discover potentials quickly. Goal: Frictionless entry to hook users in <2 minutes.  
**Business Value:** 80% of drop-off happens pre-profile; this gets users to first whisper fast.  
**Success Metrics:** 70% completion rate; average profile setup time <90s.

### User Story 1.1: Sign Up and Basic Profile Creation
**As a new user**, I want to sign up and create a basic profile so I can start browsing immediately without feeling overwhelmed.  
**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Supported method: Google Sign-In (pulls display name/photo if permitted).
- Required fields: Age (18+ validation), gender/orientation (dropdowns: Male/Female/Non-binary/Prefer not to say; Straight/Gay/Bi/Pan/Ace/Other), location (auto-detect via device, editable city-only for privacy).
- Optional: 1-5 photos (upload from gallery/camera; auto-crop/suggest best; max 5MB each; no NSFW auto-flag via basic ML if available).
- Bio: 0-150 characters (text only; no links).
- Interests: Select 3-5 from predefined tags (e.g., "Hiking", "Coffee", "Books"—20+ options; searchable).
- Deal-breakers: Toggle 1-3 (e.g., "No smokers", "Kids? Yes/No").
- Post-setup: Auto-redirect to browse feed; prompt "Toggle 'Open to Whispers'?" (default: Yes).
- Edge Cases: Sign-in errors → Suggest retry or support; Under 18 → Block with resources link.
- UI: Single-screen wizard with progress bar; skip option for optionals.

### User Story 1.2: Profile Discovery Feed
**As a signed-in user**, I want a curated feed of profiles so I can browse potentials based on compatibility without endless scrolling.  
**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Feed shows 10-20 profiles/day (algorithm: 70% interest match, 20% location <50km, 10% random for serendipity).
- Each card: Blurred photo teaser (unblurs on tap), name/age/location snippet, 1 interest badge, bio preview (first 50 chars + "Read more").
- Filters: Toggle by orientation/interests (persistent until cleared).
- Actions per card: "Whisper Hi" button (triggers Epic 2) or "Pass" (swipe left gesture).
- Refresh: Pull-to-refresh; no infinite load—daily reset to prevent fatigue.
- Personalization: After 5 interactions, refine feed (e.g., more "Coffee" if liked those).
- Edge Cases: No matches → Show "Expand filters?" or fun placeholder ("Your polite prince is out there—try tomorrow!").
- UI: Vertical scroll; card height fixed at 200px; accessibility: Alt text for images.

### User Story 1.3: Edit Profile Anytime
**As an existing user**, I want to update my profile so I can refine it based on feedback or mood.  
**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Accessible from settings/menu (top-right avatar tap).
- Same fields as signup; changes save instantly with confirmation toast ("Profile updated—fresh feed incoming!").
- Photo management: Add/delete/reorder; enforce 1-5 limit.
- Privacy toggles: "Open to Whispers" (global on/off); hide location (shows "Nearby" instead).
- Edge Cases: Bio over 150 chars → Truncate with warning; invalid photo → Reject upload.
- UI: Modal sheet; preview button to see live changes.

## Epic 2: Whisper Creation & Sending
**Description:** Core initiation: Record, check, and send audio openers. Enforces politeness while keeping it fun and safe.  
**Business Value:** This is the app's soul—effortful "May I?" clips filter for quality.  
**Success Metrics:** 60% of sent clips get played; average clip length 20-30s.

### User Story 2.1: Record a Whisper Clip
**As an initiator**, I want to record a short audio clip starting with the required phrase so I can express genuine interest without overthinking.  
**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Trigger: Tap "Whisper Hi" on a profile card.
- Recording: One-tap mic button; max 45 seconds (visual timer bar; auto-stop at limit).
- Required Start: Must begin with exact phrase "May I meet you because..." (app listens post-record; if missing, prompt "Add the magic words?" with re-record nudge—non-blocking).
- Content: Free-form after phrase (e.g., tie to their bio/interests); no text overlay needed.
- Controls: Pause/resume; preview playback; unlimited re-records (discard button clears).
- Offline Support: Record offline; queue for upload on connect.
- Edge Cases: Mic permission denied → Fallback to text note (but flag as "low-effort"); <5s clip → Warn "Too short—add a why?".
- UI: Full-screen modal; waveform visualizer; "Send" disabled until previewed.

### User Story 2.2: Safety Check with Gemini
**As the app**, I want to automatically scan clips for inappropriate content before sending so the community stays safe and positive.  
**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Post-preview: Auto-run Google Gemini API on audio transcription (speech-to-text first, then analyze).
- Checks: Detect profanity, threats, harassment, explicit references (e.g., score 0-1; threshold >0.2 = flag).
- Outcomes:
  - Pass: Instant green check ("All good—sending!"); proceed to send.
  - Fail: Soft block modal ("This might not land right—try re-recording?") with generic tips (e.g., "Keep it light and positive"); no specifics to avoid bias.
- Logging: Anonymized flags to backend for manual review (e.g., 3+ flags → temp ban).
- No Improv: Gemini only detects—does not suggest rewrites or edits.
- Edge Cases: API downtime → Queue and retry; non-English clips → Basic English fallback (expand later).
- Performance: <5s scan time; user sees spinner ("Quick vibe check...").

### User Story 2.3: Send and Daily Limits
**As an initiator**, I want to send clips with soft limits so I focus on quality over quantity.  
**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Post-safety pass: Tap "Send" → Confirmation toast ("Whisper sent—fingers crossed!"); clip queues to receiver's inbox.
- Limit: 5 clips/day (resets at midnight UTC); visual counter in header ("3/5 left").
- Exceeded: Gentle block ("Daily whispers maxed—come back tomorrow for more magic!"); no hard paywall.
- Notifications: Push alert on send ("Your whisper is en route!").
- Edge Cases: Receiver blocks you → Clip auto-fails silently; network fail → Retry prompt.
- UI: Send button pulses green on pass; limit badge in nav bar.

## High-Level User Flows
### Flow 1: End-to-End Whisper Journey (Core Loop)
```
1. User A opens app → Browses feed (Epic 1.2) → Taps profile → "Whisper Hi" (2.1)
2. Records clip ("May I meet you because...") → Previews → Gemini scans (2.2) → If pass: Sends (2.3) → Limit check OK
3. User B gets push → Opens inbox (3.1) → Views A's profile → Plays clip (3.2) → A notified (+1 score, 3.3)
4. B approves → Both notified → Chat unlocks (4.1) → Exchange messages
5. If decline: Clip deletes; A sees no update
(Branch: If limit hit → Daily cap message)
```

### Flow 2: Onboarding to First Send
```
1. Open mayimeetyou.app in a browser → Sign up (1.1: Google Sign-In → Basic profile) → "Open to Whispers?" toggle
2. Redirect to feed (1.2) → Browse 3 cards → Select one → Record/send first clip (Epic 2)
3. Success: Toast + score init (0 plays)
```

### Flow 3: Safety Fail Handling
```
1. Record → Preview → Gemini flag (2.2) → Modal: "Try again?" + tip
2. Re-record → Pass → Send
(If 3 fails/day → Soft warn: "Taking a breather?")
```

**Testing Notes:** Each story needs unit/integration tests (e.g., mock Gemini for CI); beta with 50 users for flow validation. Verify all Epics 1-5 for final build.

This leaves zero gray areas—devs can quote stories directly for tasks. Ready to sprint? Or add P2 stories like "Share Funny Clips Anon"?
